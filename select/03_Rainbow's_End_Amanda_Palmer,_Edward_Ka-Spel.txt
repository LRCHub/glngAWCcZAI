I am a little bluish dot
Lost in a sea of grey
The web of streets around me
In a box has gone away

Nothing loads, it only spins
And the child-lock keeps me in
The signal flashes green
And then decays

I maybe should've just ignored that little voice inside
You know, the aimless one that counts to three then whispers, "Drive"
The one word that was uttered
At the moment that it mattered
We would leave them
Hoping someday I'd arrive
(Arrive, arrive)

I reached out for the shiny button
But it wouldn't scan
I heard a voice from in the static
Shouting 'bout a land
Where the highways form a spiral
And the stories all go viral
For a day that lasts a lifetime
In a frozen block of sand

I am blinking in the night
He is turning to the right
He whispered, reaching for a light

I am sinking in the grey
It is not night, it is not day
And then we drove away

We're somewhere on the telly
In the middle of a road
The story can't be finished
'Cause this picture still won't load
They say that I'm not breathing
But I simply don't believe them
And as soon as this is working
I'll make him take me home
Home
"Home?"
(Home)
